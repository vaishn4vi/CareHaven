            CareHaven started as a simple idea among four friends who wanted to address a major issue in modern healthcare:
            the fragmentation of services across various apps. We envisioned a comprehensive healthcare platform where users 
            could access everything they need without switching between apps. From tracking personal health metrics to finding 
            nearby hospitals and managing appointments, CareHaven was born out of our collective passion to simplify healthcare 
            and save peopleâ€™s time.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we set out to develop CareHaven, we combined our unique strengths and skills to create a seamless experience for 
            our users. Together, we aim to make healthcare accessible, organized, and efficient for everyone.
